Release Notes: Revive Adserver 3.1.0
====================================

These release notes cover what's new, system requirements, download and
installation instructions, known issues and frequently asked questions for
Revive Adserver. Please read these notes before reporting any bugs.


What's New in Revive Adserver 3.1.0
-----------------------------------

 * Release date: 17 December 2014

 Security Updates
 ----------------

 * CVE-2014-8793 - Fixed Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability
 * CVE-2014-8875 - Fixed Denial-of-Service vulnerability

 For more information:
 http://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2014-002

 New Features
 ------------

 * Blank impressions are now logged and taken into account during
   prioritization. This should allow using zones without remnant campaigns,
   which was previously discouraged. Blank impressions are also counted in the
   "Global History" and "Website & Zones" statistic screens and separately
   displayed in the "Campaign distribution" tab for websites and zones.

 * The "Contract (Exclusive)" campaign type has been re-named to "Override".

 * Added the ability to intentionally attempt to over deliver Contract campaigns
   by a given percentage of impressions against the predicted "ideal" to help
   ensure that Contract campaigns always meet their contracted delivery by their
   end date.

 * The Revive Adserver delivery engine now includes a completely inclusive
   CORS header (i.e. 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *').

 * The domain used for the viewerId cookie is now configurable.

 * The "My Account" main menu has been re-named to "Preferences" for clarity.

 * The quick navigation dropdown lists for advertisers/campaigns and websites is
   now sorted alphabetically.

 * The "midnight" sync process that checks for updates to Revive Adserver is
   now the very last thing to happen in the overall maintenance process.

 Bug Fixes
 ---------

 * Fixed a problem with timezones not being taken into account when running
   the zone allocation algorithm during maintenance. This resulted in
   underdelivery if the account timezone had a positive offset from UTC, and
   potentially some overdelivery otherwise.

 * Fixed the editing of campaigns when conversion tracking is disabled.

 * Fixed the preview of all banners on the "Banners" page user interface
   preference.

 * Fixed incorrectly displayed error message when trying to link a banner to
   an email zone where the banner's parent campaign dates overlap with an
   already linked campaign.

 * Fixed incorrectly displayed message stating that a link has been created when
   trying to link an email zone to a banner where the banner's parent campaign
   dates overlap with an already linked campaign.

 * VAST tracking URLs now use https:// when called via SSL.

 * Removed useless Content-Length headers when sending the 1x1 transparent gif
   and spc delivery files, as the header interferes with ob_gzhandler and/or
   zlib.output_compression.

 * Fixed issue with banner delivery over SSL when using Postgres.

 * Fixed click redirection to internationalized domain names when the IDN
   functions are available (PHP 5.3+).

 * Properly display the current value in the UI when settings contain an
   underscore in their name.

 * Properly display 'Site - Variable' delivery limitations when the value is set
   to zero (i.e. '0').

 * Fixed product name and removed bad documentation link on installer pre-check
   warning page.

 * Allow Revive Adserver to be installed on Debian Wheezy PHP versions that have
   had a critical PHP bugfix backported.

 * Fixed an issue with old creative file being deleted although still in use
   when a banner image file was replaced.

 * Fixed use of custom application name in the generation of zone invocation
   tags; made the use of this consistent across tracker beacons and SPC tags
   as well, and removed all incorrect code relating to a non-existent user
   preference.

 * Added compatibility for systems affected by PHP bug #53829, i.e. having
   gzopen64 rather than gzopen.

 * Fixed a problem with frequency capping/blocking not working for video ads.

 * Fixed an issue in distributed maintenance trying to migrate unsupported
   plugin statistics.

 * Updated ISO-3166 country codes to the latest available version. This also
   fixes an issue with Serbia country targeting previously not working.

 Non-Backwards Compatible Changes
 --------------------------------

 * Revive Adserver now requires PHP 5.3+

 * HTML banners no longer present URL and Target fields in the user interface
   unless editing an existing HTML banner where one of these fields is present;
   the URL(s) and target(s) should be set as part of the HTML banner.

 * A number of database table columns are removed as part of the upgrade
   process for Revive Adserver 3.1.0, as they were deprecated with the removal
   of the OpenX Market in version 3.0.0. Please ensure that you back up your
   Revive Adserver database before upgrading to 3.1.0.

 * Existing accounts with the name "Default manager" will be updated to
   "Default Account" to ensure the account name is consistent with updated
   language files. Similarly, existing accounts with the name "Administrator
   account" will be updated to "System Administrator".

 * Activation/deactivation emails and scheduled reports are now disabled by
   default when creating new advertisers via the API, in order to match the UI
   behaviour. This does not affect any existing advertiser account settings for
   this feature; but please be aware that the default for all new advertiser
   accounts has been changed.

 * The adRender hook function signature was missing the $richMedia argument before
   $loc and $referer. Please make sure you double check your custom plugins in
   case they use such hook.

Known Issues
------------

This list covers some of the known problems with Revive Adserver. Please read
this before reporting any new bugs.

 * The upgrade process may time out with very large databases. See
   http://www.revive-adserver.com/docs/faq for more information if you
   have a large database.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with MySQL, please note that MySQL 4.1 or
   higher is required. If you are using an older version of MySQL, you will
   need to update you database software before upgrading.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with PostgreSQL, please note that
   PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher is required. If you are using an older version of
   PostgreSQL, you will need to update your database software before
   upgrading.

 * Some of the PEAR libraries used are not compatible with database prefix
   names with double "_" characters (e.g. "rv__"). You should NOT install
   Revive Adserver with a prefix of this format.

 * Some users have reported issues of being logged out when viewing
   statistics. This can be worked around by ensuring that the timezone is
   correctly set in PHP.
